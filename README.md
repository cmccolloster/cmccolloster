# 🦝 Christopher McColloser

My name is Christopher McColloser. I am currently a junior pursuing a degree in Computer Science/Cybersecurity at Louisiana State University.

As a child, I always wondered how some wiring in a plastic/metal case could display colorful imagery across a television screen; however, it was not always cheerful. Being a naive kid, I was susceptible to viruses and malware that ran rampant online and succumbed to their attacks. As I aged, I realized that I wanted to protect the online world from those dangers by seeing how they ticked and prevent the same events that happened to me from happening to someone else.

### 💻 Some things I've worked on

* [TripTrak](https://github.com/cobyknight/TripTrak/tree/main): A simple react native mobile app created for CSC 4330. Essentially a travel app for tourists looking for the best local dining experience.

This section is a work in progress and intends to be updated.
